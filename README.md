This is a simple Calculator Application developed in Java. The app allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two numbers. It also includes error handling to manage exceptions like division by zero or invalid input.

Features
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/) with division by zero handling
User-friendly interface with simple inputs
Error handling for invalid inputs and exceptions
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java (JDK 8 or higher)
IDE or text editor for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
Command-line interface or terminal to run the application
Running the Application
Clone or Download the Repository:

If using Git, clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.
Navigate to the Project Directory:


cd calculator-app
Compile the Java Code: Use the following command to compile the code:


javac CalculatorApp.java
Run the Application: After compiling, run the application with:


java CalculatorApp
Follow the Prompts: The program will prompt you to:

Enter the first number
Enter the second number
Enter the arithmetic operator (e.g., +, -, *, /)
The result of the operation will then be displayed.

Example Output

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): /
The result is: 2.0
In case of division by zero:


Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 0
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): /
Error: Cannot divide by zero.
Code Structure
The CalculatorApp.java file contains:

Input Handling: Uses the Scanner class to accept user inputs.
Switch-Case Logic: For performing the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the operator.
Exception Handling: Catches invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero or non-numeric inputs) using try-catch.
Finally Block: Ensures that the Scanner object is closed.
Error Handling
The app gracefully handles:

Division by Zero: Displays a meaningful error message when trying to divide by zero.
Invalid Input: If the user enters a non-numeric value or invalid operator, the program catches the exception and displays an error message.
Future Improvements
Support for more advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
Addition of a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
Support for continuous operations (e.g., multiple inputs and calculations in a single run).
